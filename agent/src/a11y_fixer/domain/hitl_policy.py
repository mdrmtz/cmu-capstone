"""Risk-routing decision predicates for the HITL Bounded Decider.

Pure functions: given a violation's rule/file/measured confidence, decide
whether a candidate fix may be auto-delivered or must be escalated to a
human. `hitl/review_queue.py` wraps these predicates with the actual queue
mechanics and calibration (ROC/AUC, threshold tuning).

# removed (2026-09) once ViolationState.HITL_QUEUED started tracking escalated
# violations properly across runs - keeping them here was papering over
